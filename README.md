# Data Engineering Project: Relationship between the Charging Point Infrastructure and Electromobility in Germany

## Context
This repository is the result of my participation in the course [Advanced Methods of Software Engineering](https://oss.cs.fau.de/teaching/specific/amse/) provided by the [Professorship of Open-Source Software](https://oss.cs.fau.de) from FAU. <br>
The task was to build a Data Engineering Project, which takes at least two public available datasources and processes them with an automated datapipeline, in order to report some findings from the result.

## Project
My aim for the project, was to investigate if there is a relationship between the charging point infrastructure and electromobility in Germany. The get insights on the the results of this project take a look at [project/report.ipynb](https://github.com/nmarkert/amse/blob/main/project/report.ipynb). 

Other files of interest:
* [project/project-plan.md](): Summarizes the plan of the project, including used datasources and work packages
* [project/datasources.ipynb](): Gives more insight into the used datasources
* [data/datapipeline.py](): Python script for the automated datapipeline
* [project/exploratin.ipynb](): Explores the data generated by the datapipeline

The project also uses an Continous Integration Pipeline, powered by GitHub Actions, in order to lint all python files and test the datapipeline on each push.

## Exercises
During the semester there were also five exercises to work on, which all required to build a datapipeline based on a given task.
More information, including the given tasks and my solutions to them, you ca find in [exercises](https://github.com/nmarkert/amse/tree/main/exercises).
